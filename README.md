# 5v-Battery-Cell-w-Charge-Indicator
<h3>5v Battery cell inspired by Subnautica and Titanfall.</h3>

<p>This is a project that turns boring batteries into a satisfying mechanisim. Inspired by games like Subnautica and Titanfall, you simply insert and twist to plug it in. Designed to last a long time for circuits running 5v at < 1.5A. This circuit includes a <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps61023.pdf?HQS=dis-dk-null-digikeymode-dsf-pf-null-wwe&ts=1617863529482">TSP61023 boost converter</a>, <a href="https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/268/AVR32_16DD20_14_Prel_DataSheet_DS40002413-2997818.pdf">AVR16DD14 microcontroller</a>, and a <a href="https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/MAX17048-MAX17049.pdf">MAX17048 Fuel gauge</a>. Device also features <a href="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/2686/SK6812MINI_REV.01-1-2.pdf">SK6812MINI RGB LEDs</a> for the outward facing indicator.</p>
